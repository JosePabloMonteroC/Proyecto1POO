"ðŸš¨ Mercedes' second post-#AbuDhabiGP protest has also been officially dismissed.Provided there is no appeal that takes this further, Max Verstappen is your 2021 #F1 champion (again!):https://t.co/RvN0FRxmga"
Verstappen still F1 Champion as Merc protests rejected. Not the way anyone wanted to see it but I feel Red Bull would have done the same. Well done Max. Maybe F1 needed a new champion and with 2022 and all the changes - we have a ding dong battle next year! #AbuDhabiGP #F1

Two protests lodged with the FIA from Mercedes over the race. Suspect related to a breach/breaches of Article 39.12 #AbuDhabiGP #F1

David Croft: â€œMy understanding is that Mercedes have launched 2 protests.â€  #AbuDhabiGP #F1
Two identical cars (M1 procar style). Lewis vs Max. 10 laps. Some different stewards to the F1 ones. Winner takes all. #AbuDhabiGP #f1

@tedkravitz @SkySportsF1 Ted - itâ€™s article 48.12 in the current version of the regulations #AbuDhabiGP #F1
Still waiting for the FIA to organise and broadcast a fight between Horner and Wolff as a season final #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"2/2: This absurd ending to the season was unfair to both @LewisHamilton &amp; @Max33Verstappen. Lewis lost what would've been his 8th championship, while Max will forever have an asterisk next to his title in the @F1 record books. Neither driver deserved this! ðŸ˜” #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
"1/2: This conclusion to the season wasn't fair to anyone. In a span of 2 minutes, Michael Masi &amp; whoever else was involved in the restart decisions turned a riveting @F1 season into a massive controversy with a result whose legitimacy will be debated for years ðŸ¤¬ #AbuDhabiGP #F1"

"Mercedes will appeal, challenge, take it to court, whatever it takes.This is FAR from over. #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
"Biases aside, @Max33Verstappen deserved this championship. Would like to see him clean up the wheel to wheel racecraft, but definitely the best season of the 20 drivers. But anyone who appreciates this sport should be despondent about the @FIA's management.#AbuDhabiGP #F1"
"The only explanation from the FIA is that the rules were not followed to ensure the maximum entertainment. Massey didnâ€™t follow the rules, thereâ€™s not debate about that. #AbuDhabiGP #f1"
"Yâ€™all need to keep Latifiâ€™s name out of your mouths, he literally didnâ€™t do anything wrong. It wasnâ€™t his decision to break the rules. Heâ€™s not involved in this, itâ€™s not his fault.#AbuDhabiGP #F1"
"#AbuDhabiGP #F1Hey, can anyone at @MercedesAMGF1 tell Totto that the lion awoken in Brazil can go to sleep now? Probably been awake a little too long"
Kevin Magnussen: â€œThe FIA stewards are doing what they think are right to get a race under way.â€ Nicolas Kiesa: â€œThey would have done the same if there was 30 laps left. The decision is not strange.â€  #AbuDhabiGP #F1
What a way to decide the championship. Was this year going to end in any other way other than breathless racing and a hell of controversy! #AbuDhabiGP #f1

How can you let a Championship be decided by implementing half a rule and let 5 Cars only unlap themselves at the very last second. Either implement the rule or leave it be. No one wants to Win a Championship in that way. Massi you're out of your depth I'm afraid.#AbuDhabiGP #F1

The 8th title is cursed. Schumacher lost his in Suzuka in 2006 when a minor part failed while leading. I think the sheer bizarreness of today's race means we can confirm the idea of an 8th title is an affront to some sort of god #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"the last lap of #AbuDhabiGP #F1 is peak sport entertainment for me, that drive me crazy, nervous &amp; can't hold my breath until the end of race (i support max)only similar when watch Euro 2020 final penalty shoot-out between italy &amp; england (i support italy of course)"

You canâ€™t just clear the cars out in front of Max - either you let all cars unlap or you donâ€™t. Looks like Michael just makes the rules up as he goes. #AbuDhabiGP #f1
"For as great as that finish was, Ted Kravitz is right. The flip-flopping of the rules were bemusing. Oh well, it gave us a great finish. #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
THAT'S WHAT I'M WAITING FOR OMG DANIEL AND MAAAAX ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­#AbuDhabiGP ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ª #F1
That was intense! Well done Max! What a Champion! ðŸ‘‘#AbuDhabiGP #F1 ðŸ™ƒ https://t.co/WZYfBuezoJ
I guess they made Hamilton give back the position to Verstappen Just took till the end of the race.#AbuDhabiGP #F1
Hearing toto wolf crying over the radio to Masi is EVERYTHING to me#AbuDhabiGP #F1
"To defend Mercedes, only 5 cars were allowed to unlap themselves. As I understand the rule, ALL cars need to unlap themselves. But, thereâ€™s is some flexibility within that. I just donâ€™t know how much. #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
Omg can we just accept it and stop with the sour grapes please Mercedes. Anyone with a hint of sense can figure out why the stewards did what they did.. no one wanted the race to finish under safety car conditions #AbuDhabiGP #F1
The race restart will be debated for a long time.. #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"Thatâ€™s real racing there!, no technicalities just dog fight of a last lap and best driver of the season takes the championship! @Max33Verstappen #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
CAN YOU FUCKIN BELIEVE IT!!! #AbuDhabiGP #F1 https://t.co/1kP2lSAsbE
Both of us (Pete and Alex) are absolutely flabbergasted by the end of that! #AbuDhabiGP #F1

Best drama thriller of 2021 - #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"So here's the thing, I understand the frustration of Mercedes, but at the same time, I think they bungled the strategy under the VSC for Giovinazzi. They should've pitted Hamilton to cover off Verstappen, or to at least get fresh tires. #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
Thereâ€™s a bit of a Chick Hicks Piston Cup feel about it though #AbuDhabiGP #F1
Not the ending we should have had. I wanted a proper race to the end #AbuDhabiGP #F1

Verstappen is not a champion if he has to win like that! #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"Lots of babies this week being named Max. Mega season and, if you look back to his mid-season dominance, a champion driver. #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
What a fucking scandal!#AbuDhabiGP #F1
That was mental #AbuDhabiGP #F1
Twice.. they had two opportunities. Clearly Lewis or his strategy team didn't want to race Max side by side on fresh tyres and was building a pace advantage to avoid him. #AbuDhabiGP #F1 https://t.co/1ok7oeECto
"Well this is going to go to court, see you guys next season when we will know who won it#AbuDhabiGP #F1"
Why only 5 cars where allowed to unlap? #AbuDhabiGP #F1
Congratulation to max and @redbullracing ðŸ‘ðŸ¼âœ¨ðŸ‘ðŸ¼âœ¨kenceng + top notch driver ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼ðŸ‘ðŸ¼#AbuDhabiGP #F1
Unlucky for Lewis Hamilton but he still had a great season! And he will be back stronger! @LewisHamilton  #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"They didnâ€™t even let all of the cars overtake, according to Ted? Joke of a racing series #AbuDhabiGP #F1"
No this isnâ€™t right!!! They fixed that so that Max was right behind Lewisâ€¦ if lapped cars are allowed to overtake that means ALL lapped cars NIT just the ones between Lewis and Max?? Absolute disgrace!!! #AbuDhabiGP #f1

Wow they ended the season like thatâ€¦ why not all the cars that was lapped pass?!? That was the rules FIA FUCK YOU!!!! #AbuDhabiGP #F1
The biggest robbery in sports history wanted there to be one lap of racing where it clearly benefitted max  #AbuDhabiGP #F1
I've seen better organised cart races. That was an utter disgrace from the World Governing Body for Motorsport. The @FIA should hang their heads in complete shame! Why were only 5 cars allowed to unlap themselves before the restart? The outcome was fixed! #AbuDhabiGP #F1 https://t.co/HlAa5UZlUt

"Said it last race, no confidence in the FIA #AbuDhabiGP #f1"
Why did FIA let the lapped cars pass the safety car? This feels so unfair.. #AbuDhabiGP #F1
But letâ€™s be real: if this happend to Verstappen I would have been crying â€˜robbed of the titleâ€™â€¦.so I get that Mercedes and Hamilton will feel exactly like that: robbed of the title. Iâ€™m soooo happy for Verstappend but I do feel so sorry for Hamilton. #AbuDhabiGP #F1
I get that you want to finish a race under green flag conditions. But that was taking the piss. Procedures bypassed just to create drama. I was always going to go one way after the safety car came in. It should have stayed out. #AbuDhabiGP #F1
The FIA literally made up the rules as they go. That was so blatant that It taints the sport in my eyes. What a shit show. #AbuDhabiGP #F1
"I pray that Mercedes enquire, because rules are rules, that wasnâ€™t fair! #AbuDhabiGP #F1"

I think the right decision was made to let the overtaken cars thru (were they all let thru or only the 5 between Lewis and Max but?) but it just took so long to make the call. Hmm. Well done Max I guess.#AbuDhabiGP#f1
